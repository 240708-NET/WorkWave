## Meeting 3
# Set up Real project repository
# Establish project sub directories and begin establishing project structure

# User-story updates:
- I should be able to add a tag to a task (Urgent etc.)
// Prioritization of previous user stories..
// These go first as they pertain to project functionality
- I should be able to create a new board/card to organize my tasks into
- I should be able to move the tasks from each tracker section
- I should be able to update or delete a task
- I should be able to categorize the current state of my task (todo- in progress- completed)
- I should be able to specify who the task is for(front end team/ backend team/ UI team etc.)

// These are added after for access to project for multiple users/persistance.
- I should be able to register for an account
- I should be able to login and access my saved tasks
- I should be able to log out of my account


# Establish our Many-To-Many Concept!!!!
- The user story regarding tags for tasks - many tasks can be assigned to a tag, and many tags can be assigned to a task.


# Questions:
- For API documentation, does that just mean we use swagger or do we need something else?



# Stretch goal reference:
- Have one user be able to have multiple project boards.
- Have one project board be available to multiple users.
