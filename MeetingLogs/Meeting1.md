# Kanban application (todo-doing-done task manager)
- Description: Project manager that allows for CRUD functionality through vizualized workflow cards/boards. Create tasks to track, read/pull all current and previous tasks, update tasks (what the task is for, AND/OR task progress), and delete tasks (when complete or no longer needed). This application allows for user productivity tracking and management.

# User stories
- I should be able to register for an account
- I should be able to login and access my saved tasks
- I should be able to log out of my account
- I should be able to create a new board/card to organize my tasks into
- I should be able to move the tasks from each tracker section
- I should be able to update or delete a task
- I should be able to categorize the current state of my task (todo- in progress- completed)
- I should be able to specify who the task is for(front end team/ backend team/ UI team etc.)



- We will break down the project via splitting the user-stories evenly vs more frontend-backend split.
- This way everyone will get experience with both "sides" while still collaborating with others in the group who may have more experience in a certain area.
